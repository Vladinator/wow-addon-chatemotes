Chat Emotes
======================

The addon was created with inspiration drawn from [Twitch Emotes v2](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/twitch-emotes-v2) by [ren9790](https://www.curseforge.com/members/ren9790)

The Twitch emotes were processed and bundled into a package.

The Discord emotes were also bundled into their own package, part of the addon.

Both load with the addon, more functionality and modularity will be added, for now this a early release addon.

Autocomplete
======================
Using `#` will start searching for emotes fitting the text you write. Tab to cycle through the options, and Enter to select and insert the desired emote. This might not always appear in special chats due to some issues re-using the autocomplete system native to the game, might have to implement a custom one that won't conflict if sharing doesn't end up working.
