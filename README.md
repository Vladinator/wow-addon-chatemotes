Chat Emotes
======================

The addon was created with inspiration drawn from [Twitch Emotes v2](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/twitch-emotes-v2) by [ren9790](https://www.curseforge.com/members/ren9790)

Packages
======================

Note that for this addon to function properly, you'll need to also grab a package with emotes.

- [Twitch](https://github.com/Vladinator89/wow-addon-chatemotes-twitch)

Commands
======================
You can open the emote picker interface using `/ce`

Autocomplete
======================
Using `#` will start searching for emotes fitting the text you write. Tab to cycle through the options, and Enter to select and insert the desired emote. This might not always appear in special chats due to some issues re-using the autocomplete system native to the game, might have to implement a custom one that won't conflict if sharing doesn't end up working.
